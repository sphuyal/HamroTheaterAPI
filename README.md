# HamroTheatre Api
- Done in Windows 10 
- Run "npm install" to download all packages for a system. 
- Run 'npm install nodemon --save' to download nodemon for a system (nodemon may not be install even if all packages are install)
- Run 'npm run dev' to start the api in localhost:3002.
- Thank You!!
